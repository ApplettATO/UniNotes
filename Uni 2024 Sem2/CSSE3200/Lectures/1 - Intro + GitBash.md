# Week 1
# Course Outline
- Assessment due dates
- Studio things
	- form teams by week 2
# Git
- Change Control
- Commit
	- Commit in stages with messages
- Staging
	- choose specific files to commit
- Reversion
	- Never go back
	- Take the most recent working version -> move to the head
- History
	- Always provide a comment when you commit
	- Change log
- Diff
	- What is the difference between revisions
	- Compare to see what changed if a version is not working but a previous one was working
	- Line by line comparison of what changed
- Tagging
	- Which revision version attached to commit
		- e.g version 1.0, version 2.0, sprint 1, sprint 2, sprint 3, etc
	- Not every commit has a tag
- Branching
	- If Person A has version 1.0 and Person B has version 2.0 branching can be used to fix a bug in version 1.0 without changing version 2.0

	- 1.x branch is disconnected from the main branch
	- 2.x branch is connected to the main branch
	- Commands
		- branch lists the available branches
		- -d delete branches
		- checkout switches to working copy
		- checkout -b creates a new branch
- Merging 
	- ![[Pasted image 20240725114205.png]]
	- 3 way merging
	- Connect a branch with the main branch
	- Sometimes require manual intervention
		- Chances of this are higher when there are more differences between branches
		- If two people make a change at the same time
- Local Version Control
	- Revision history on local machine
- Centralised Version Control
	- Revision history on central server
	- Less likely to lose revision history
	- Only has what people have committed
	- Possible for the server to be overworked
	- Overall not a great idea
- Distributed Version Control
	- Everyone has everything
	- Repositories are synchronised
- Other
	- History is a directed acyclic graph
	- Clone
	- Last bit talks about what happens when you push, pull, fetch, etc
	- Pull = Fetch + Merge
